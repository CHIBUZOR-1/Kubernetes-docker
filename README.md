## CI/CD Pipeline
This project uses a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and deployment process:
1. **Push Code**: GitHub Actions is triggered whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.
2. **Build Docker Image**: The pipeline automatically builds the updated Docker image.
3. **Push to Docker Hub**: The image is pushed to Docker Hub (`chibuzor1/dapp3:latest`) for easy access.
4. **Deploy**: The latest image is pulled and deployed to Render or Kubernetes.

This process ensures seamless updates and reliable deployments.

## Kubernetes Deployment
If you want to deploy this project using Kubernetes, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Minikube or Kubernetes is Set Up**:
   - Install Minikube by downloading from official website or use a managed Kubernetes cluster.
   - Link: [ðŸ”— Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
   - Add folder to System Environment variables under Path.

2. **Docker Desktop**:

   - Install Docker Desktop by downloading it from Docker's official website.

   - Once installed, open Docker Desktop and ensure it is running. Set Docker as the default driver for Minikube:
   ```
   minikube config set driver docker
   ```
3. **kubectl (Kubernetes CLI)**:

   - Install kubectl by following the instructions for your operating system from the official Kubernetes website and add folder to system variables under Path.

   - Link: [ðŸ”— Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

   - Verify the installation by running:
   ```
   kubectl version --client
   ```

4. **Start Minikube**:
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```
5. **Apply the Kubernetes Manifests: Deploy the resources defined in the YAML files:**
   ```
    kubectl -- apply -f K8s/configmap.yaml
    kubectl -- apply -f K8s/secrets.yaml
    kubectl apply -f K8s/deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f K8s/service.yaml
   ```
   ## OR
   ```
    kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```
6. **Check the Pods and Services: Verify that the pods are running and the service is active:**
   ```
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get service
   ```
7. **Access the Application:**
   - If using Minikube, expose the service and open it in your browser:
   ```
    minikube service mern-app-service
   ```
   - For external clusters, use the external IP provided by the service.
